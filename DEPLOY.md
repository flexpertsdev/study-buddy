# Login to Netlify (first time only)
netlify login

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy
```

## Important Notes

1. **API Key Security**: Never commit your API key to git. Always use environment variables.
2. **Usage Costs**: Each image analysis uses OpenAI API credits. Monitor your usage.
3. **Local Storage**: All notebook data is saved in the user's browser. Clearing browser data will delete saved entries.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Analysis failed" error**: Check that your OpenAI API key is correctly set in Netlify
- **Images not analyzing**: Ensure the image is clear and contains a graph/chart
- **Notebook not saving**: Check browser's local storage settings
